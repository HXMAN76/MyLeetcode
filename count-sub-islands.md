# Intuition  
The problem is about counting the number of sub-islands in `grid2` that are also present in `grid1`. A sub-island is defined as an island in `grid2` that is completely contained within an island in `grid1`. To solve this, we need to explore each island in `grid2` and check if all its land cells (1s) correspond to land cells in `grid1`.  

# Approach  
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a count for the valid sub-islands. We will iterate through each cell in `grid2`.  
2. **Island Detection**: For each cell that is part of an island (i.e., `grid2[i][j] == 1`), we will use a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the entire island.  
3. **Check Validity**: During the DFS, we will mark the cells in `grid2` as visited by changing them to 0. We will also check if the corresponding cells in `grid1` are land (1). If any cell in `grid2` is land while its corresponding cell in `grid1` is water (0), we mark the island as invalid.  
4. **Count Valid Islands**: If the island is valid after the DFS completes, we increment our count of valid sub-islands.  
5. **Return the Count**: Finally, return the count of valid sub-islands.  

# Complexity  
- Time complexity: $$O(n \cdot m)$$, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is visited once during the DFS.  
- Space complexity: $$O(n \cdot m)$$ in the worst case due to the recursion stack during the DFS, especially for large islands.

## Algorithm

### Problem Statement:
Given a binary string `s` representing a positive integer, return the number of steps to reduce it to `1` under the following operations:
1. If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
2. If the current number is odd, add 1 to it.

### Approach:
To reduce the binary number to `1`, we need to consider the bits and how they change with the operations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `l`: Length of the binary string `s` minus 1 (points to the last bit).
   - `carry`: To keep track of any carry generated while processing bits.
   - `count`: To count the number of steps taken.

2. **Process Each Bit from Right to Left:**
   - Iterate through the string `s` from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost).

3. **Determine Action Based on Bit and Carry:**
   - **If the bit plus carry is 0 (even number without carry):**
     - No carry is generated.
     - Increment `count` by 1 (division by 2).
   - **If the bit plus carry is 2 (odd number with carry):**
     - A carry is generated.
     - Increment `count` by 1 (adding 1 makes it even) and an additional step to divide by 2.
   - **If the bit plus carry is 1 (odd number without carry or even number with carry):**
     - A carry is generated.
     - Increment `count` by 2 (one step to add 1 and one step to divide by 2).

4. **Handle the Most Significant Bit:**
   - If there is a carry left after processing all bits, it means we need one final step to handle the carry.

5. **Return the Total Steps Counted:**

                count += 2
            l -= 1
        #last digit 1 needs to add a carried over digit 1, which gives 10.
        #So need one more divide to make it 1 (one more step)
        if carry == 1:
            count += 1
        return count

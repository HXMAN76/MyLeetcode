# Intuition
To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of bit flips required to convert a binary representation of a number `start` to another number `goal`, my first thought is to utilize the properties of the XOR operation. The XOR operation will highlight the bits that differ between the two numbers. Each differing bit represents a flip that needs to be made.

# Approach
1. **XOR Operation**: Compute the XOR of `start` and `goal`. This will give a number where each bit is `1` if the corresponding bits of `start` and `goal` differ, and `0` if they are the same.
2. **Count Differing Bits**: To count the number of `1`s in the result from the XOR operation, we can use a technique that repeatedly clears the least significant `1` bit until the number becomes `0`. Each time we clear a bit, we increment a counter.
3. **Return the Count**: The final count will represent the minimum number of bit flips needed.

The implementation of this approach is shown in the provided Java code.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(k)$$, where `k` is the number of bits in the integer (in practice, this is constant for fixed-width integers).
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, as we are using a constant amount of space for variables.

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
        int count = 0;
        int xorval = start ^ goal;
        while (xorval != 0){
            xorval &= (xorval-1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

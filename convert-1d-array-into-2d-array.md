# Intuition
The problem requires converting a one-dimensional array into a two-dimensional array with specified dimensions \(m\) and \(n\). The main challenge is ensuring that the total number of elements in the original array matches the product of the specified dimensions. If the dimensions do not match, we should return an empty array.

# Approach
1. **Check Length**: First, verify if the length of the original array is equal to $$m \times n$$. If not, return an empty list.
2. **Construct 2D Array**: If the lengths match, iterate through the range of \(m\). For each iteration, slice the original array from $$i \times n$$ to $$ (i + 1) \times n $$ and append this slice as a new row in the resulting 2D array.
3. **Return Result**: Finally, return the constructed 2D array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(m \times n)$$  
  This is because we are iterating through the original array to create the 2D array.

- Space complexity: $$O(m \times n)$$  
  This is due to the space required to store the resulting 2D array.

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def construct2DArray(self, original: List[int], m: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
       if len(original) != m * n:
        return []
       ans = []
       for i in range(m):
        ans.append(original[i * n: (i+1) * n])
       return ans

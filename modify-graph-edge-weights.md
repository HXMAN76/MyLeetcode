# Intuition
The problem involves finding a valid path in a graph where some edges may have a weight of -1, which can be modified to ensure a certain target cost is achieved from a source node to a destination node. The initial thoughts revolve around using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths while considering the special treatment of edges with a weight of -1.

# Approach
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each node points to its neighbors along with the corresponding edge indices.
  
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - Implement Dijkstra's algorithm twice:
     - The first run calculates the minimum distance from the source to every node using the original weights, including treating -1 edges as having a weight of 1.
     - Calculate the difference between the target and the shortest path distance to determine how much additional weight needs to be distributed to the edges with -1 weights.
  
3. **Modification of Edges**:
   - In the second run of Dijkstra's, modify edges with weight -1 based on the determined difference, ensuring the computed path fulfills the target condition.

4. **Final Result**:
   - If it’s possible to adjust the graph to meet the target cost, return the modified edges; otherwise, return an empty list.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
  - The overall complexity is primarily driven by Dijkstra’s algorithm, which runs in $$O((E + V) \log V)$$ where $$E$$ is the number of edges and $$V$$ the number of vertices.

- **Space complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is $$O(V + E)$$ for the adjacency list and the distances array needed to store the shortest paths for two different runs of Dijkstra's algorithm.

# Intuition  
The problem revolves around a strategic game where two players alternately pick stones from a collection of piles, with the goal of maximizing their own score. The player whose turn it is can take a certain number of piles, with the number of piles they can take increasing based on previous moves.   

My initial thought is to use a recursive approach combined with dynamic programming (DP) to track the outcomes of different choices. The key is to recognize that each player's move affects the options available to the other player, necessitating careful consideration of future moves. The challenge lies in deciding how many piles to take, which depends on the current game state.  

Given that the opponent will also play optimally, it's vital to minimize their potential score while maximizing my own. This situation suggests a minimax strategy where I would maximize my gain while minimizing my opponent's possible score.  

# Approach  
1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:  
   - I will define a recursive function `game(i, m)`, where `i` is the current index of the piles and `m` is the maximum number of piles that the current player can take in this turn.  
   - The base case will be when the current player can take all remaining piles, in which case they simply take all the stones.  

2. **State Representation**:  
   - For each state, I will evaluate all possible moves (taking from 1 to `2*m` piles) and calculate how many stones the opponent could collect after my move. The goal here is to minimize the opponent's potential score, which can be achieved through another recursive call to `game`.  

3. **Memoization**:  
   - To avoid recalculating the results for states I have already encountered, I will use memoization. This caches results of subproblems, significantly speeding up the computation for larger inputs.  

4. **Accumulated Sums**:  
   - To efficiently calculate the total number of stones remaining for the player taking their turn, I will create an accumulated sum array that helps in determining how many stones are left in a direct manner.  

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n ^3)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(n^2)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def stoneGameII(self, piles):
        # accumulated sum table of the rest of all stores reversely for quick check
        a = [*accumulate(piles[::-1])][::-1]
		
        # dp cache 
        @lru_cache(None)
        def game(i, m): 
		    # i: current index, m: current maximal move
            # if player's move can arrive goal, get all rest stones
            if i + 2 * m >= len(piles): return a[i]
            
            # otherwise, 
            # the rest of all stones must subtract rival's minimum  
            # _minScore: rival's minimum         
            _minScore = 2**31 - 1  

            # find which move can get maximum
            # x: how many moves
            for x in range(1, 2 * m + 1):
                # get rival's score
                score = game(i + x, x) if x > m else game(i + x, m)
                # update rival's new minimum 
                if score < _minScore: _minScore = score

            # the rest of all stores of current position
            # subtract rival's minimum to get best result
            return a[i] - _minScore
            
        return game(0, 1)
```
